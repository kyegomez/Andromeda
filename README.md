# Usage
There are 2 methods to use Andromeda, 1 by `pip install Andromeda-llm` and the other by `git clone`. [Head over to the Training SOP for more](DOCs/TRAINING.md) and Head over to the Documentation for more!

# Documentation
* [Click here for the documentation.](https://github.com/kyegomez/Andromeda/blob/master/DOCs/DOCUMENTATION.md)

# Method1
First `pip install Andromeda-llm` then

```python
import torch
from Andromeda import Andromeda, Train


x = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))

Andromea(x)

# or train

Train()

```


## Method 2

Get started:

1. Clone the repository and install the required packages.


```
git clone https://github.com/kyegomez/Andromeda
cd Andromeda
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd Andromeda
python3 training_distributed.py
```

# Training

First:

`Accelerate Config`

Enable Deepspeed 3: 

`Accelerate launch train_distributed_accelerate.py`

# Environment variables

* `ENTITY_NAME` ==> Your wandb project name

* `OUTPUT_DIR` ==> Where you want the weights to go when it's finished training for example inside the root directory you can do something like: `./weights` and it'll create a folder called weights INSIDE of the Andromeda folder

## Dataset building building

Data
You can preprocess a different dataset in a way similar to the C4 dataset used during training by running the build_dataset.py script. This will pre-tokenize, chunk the data in blocks of a specified sequence length, and upload to the Huggingface hub. For example:

```python3 Andromeda/build_dataset.py --seed 42 --seq_len 8192 --hf_account "HUGGINGFACE APIKEY" --tokenizer "EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b" --dataset_name "EleutherAI/the_pile_deduplicated"```



# Inference

```python3 inference.py "My dog is very cute" --seq_len 256 --temperature 0.8 --filter_thres 0.9 --model "andromeda"``` 

Not yet we need to submit model to pytorch hub

## Model Architecture üß†üîß

```python
Andromeda = TransformerWrapper(
    num_tokens=64007,
    max_seq_len=8192,
    use_abs_pos_emb=False,
    # tokenizer=tokenizer,
    embedding_provider=AndromedaEmbedding(),
    attn_layers = Decoder(
        dim=2560, # 2048
        depth=32, # 16
        dim_head=128,
        heads=24,
        alibi_pos_bias=True,
        alibi_num_heads=12,
        rotary_xpos=True,
        attn_flash = True,
        deepnorm=True,
        shift_tokens=1,
        attn_one_kv_head = True,
        qk_norm=True,
        attn_qk_norm=True,
        attn_qk_norm_dim_scale=True # set this to True, in addition to `attn_qk_norm = True`
    )
)

Andromeda = AutoregressiveWrapper(Andromeda)
```

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏èüìç

1. **Training phase**: Train Andromeda on a large-scale dataset to achieve SOTA performance in various natural language processing tasks.

2. **World-class inference infrastructure**: Establish a robust and efficient infrastructure that leverages techniques such as:

   - Model quantization: Reduce memory and computational requirements without significant loss in performance.
   - Distillation: Train smaller, faster models that retain the knowledge of the larger model.
   - Optimized serving frameworks: Deploy Andromeda using efficient serving frameworks, such as NVIDIA Triton or TensorFlow Serving, for rapid inference.

3. **Continuous improvement**: Continuously fine-tune Andromeda on diverse data sources and adapt it to new tasks and domains.

4. **Community-driven development**: Encourage open-source contributions, including pre-processing improvements, advanced training techniques, and novel use cases.

## Why Andromeda? üå†üí°

Andromeda can potentially be finetuned with 100k+ token sequence length.
Andromeda is a state-of-the-art language model that leverages advanced techniques to optimize its performance and efficiency. Some of these techniques include alibi positional bias, rotary position encodings (xpos), flash attention, and deep normalization (deepnorm). Let's explore the benefits of these techniques and provide some usage examples.

### Alibi Positional Bias

Alibi positional bias allows the model to learn relative positions between tokens, enabling it to better capture the relationships and dependencies between tokens in a sequence.

Usage example:

```python
attn_layers = Decoder(
    ...
    alibi_pos_bias=True,
    alibi_num_heads=4,
    ...
)
```

### Rotary Position Encodings (xpos)

Rotary position encodings introduce a more efficient way to encode positions in the input sequence. They avoid the need for absolute positional embeddings, reducing the model's memory footprint and improving training speed.

Usage example:

```python
attn_layers = Decoder(
    ...
    rotary_xpos=True,
    ...
)
```

### Flash Attention

Flash attention speeds up the self-attention mechanism by reducing the number of attention computations. It accelerates training and inference while maintaining a high level of performance.

Usage example:

```python
attn_layers = Decoder(
    ...
    attn_flash=True,
    ...
)
```

Usage example:

```python
attn_layers = Decoder(
    ...
    deepnorm=True,
    ...
)
```

### Deep Normalization (deepnorm)

Deep normalization is a technique that normalizes the activations within a layer, helping with training stability and convergence. It allows the model to better learn complex patterns and generalize to unseen data.

# Andromeda Principles
- **Efficiency**: Andromeda incorporates cutting-edge optimization techniques, such as attention flashing, rotary position encodings, and deep normalization, resulting in efficient training and inference.

- **Flexibility**: The modular design of Andromeda allows for easy adaptation to various tasks and domains, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications.

- **Scalability**: Andromeda's architecture is designed to scale with the ever-growing computational resources and data sizes, ensuring its continuous relevance in the NLP landscape.

- **Community-driven**: As an open-source project, Andromeda thrives on contributions from the community, fostering an environment of collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement.

Join us on this exciting journey to create a powerful, efficient, and intelligent language model that will revolutionize the NLP landscape! üöÄüåü
